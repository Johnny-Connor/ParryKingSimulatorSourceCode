# About

The source code of [PARRY KING SIMULATOR](https://johnny-connor.itch.io/parry-king-simulator), a game crafted over four dedicated months without missing a day. The development of this project was the culmination of my six months long studies, allowing me to put into practice everything I have learned so far.

Please note that project files will not be published, as they contain some paid assets.
